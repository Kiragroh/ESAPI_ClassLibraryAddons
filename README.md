# ESAPI_ClassLibraryAddons

Copied from mtparagon5 but lightly changed. (https://github.com/mtparagon5/ESAPI-Projects/tree/master/ClassLibraries) 

The produced EsapiAdoons-v15.dll is a needed dependency for some of my projects.

Note:
- script is optimized to work with Eclipse 15.1
15.1
- absolute beginner should first read my beginnerGuide
