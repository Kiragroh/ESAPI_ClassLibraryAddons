# ESAPI_ClassLibraryAddons

Copied from mtparagon5 but lightly changed. (https://github.com/mtparagon5/ESAPI-Projects/tree/master/ClassLibraries) 

The produced EsapiAdoons-v15.dll is a needed dependency for some of my projects.

First-Compile tips:
- add your own ESAPI-DLL-Files (VMS.TPS.Common.Model.API.dll + VMS.TPS.Common.Model.Types). Usually found in C:\Program Files\Varian\RTM\15.1\esapi\API
- For clinical Mode: Approve the produced .dll in External Treatment Planning if 'Is Writeable = true'

Note:
- script is optimized to work with Eclipse 15.1
- absolute beginner should first read my beginnerGuide
